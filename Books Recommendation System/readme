📚 Book Recommendation System
A content-based recommendation system that suggests books based on user input. It uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend titles based on book descriptions (titles + authors).

🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of 11,000+ books and builds a recommendation engine that:
Explores rating distributions and author contributions.
Uses NLP techniques to vectorize book metadata.
Suggests similar books based on a user-provided title.

🧠 Techniques Used
TF-IDF Vectorization (title + author combined)
Cosine Similarity for recommendation
Plotly for interactive visualizations

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
📈 Histogram of average ratings

👩‍💻 Top 10 most frequent authors

⚙️ How It Works
Merges title and authors into a single feature.
Vectorizes the merged text using TfidfVectorizer.
Computes similarity using linear_kernel.
Recommends top 10 similar books for any given title.
